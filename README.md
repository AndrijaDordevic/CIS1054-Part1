Part 1 Task 1
HTML is the foundation of basically every web page. It’s how we tell browsers to structure content into paragraphs, headings, images, links, lists, forms, tables, buttons, and more. HTML is the front end of the code because it is the receiving end of the user.  Whilst PHP is the actual bulk of the code. This is because it allows code to be dynamically typed with other sources like a database. From webpages being dynamically typed allows plenty of advantages such as easier to update code, and more readable code. PHP is the back end of the website since it isn’t noticeable by the user, however it allows the casing of the HTML to function dynamically with other files.

Xampp (https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html) is used because it is a great tool since it is an easy-to-use interpreter and compiler for PHP. Hence it allows the hosting of a server to recognise PHP files and execute the code in a website. Moreover, Xampp allows access to a database through the use of phpMyAdmin that allows dynamic typing to be more efficient and effective. SQL is used because it is the language for databases. It is used because it allows the addition of items to be faster and more efficient than adding each item individually.
